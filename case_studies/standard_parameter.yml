# Standard parameters for power system components

# System base power for per unit calculations
SBase : 25 # System base power in MVA

#  Angle limits are in degrees, voltage limits are in per unit (p.u.)
Min_Ang: -90 # Minimum angle of the nodes in degrees
Max_Ang: 90 # Minimum and maximum angle of the nodes in degrees
Max_AngDiff: 60 # Maximum angle difference between connected nodes in degrees
Vmax: 1.1 # Upper voltage limit of the nodes in per unit
Vmin: 0.9 # Lower voltage limit of the nodes in per unit

# Shunt parameters of the nodes
Gs: 0 # Conductance of the shunt elements
Bs: 0 # Susceptance of the shunt elements

# Battery parameters
eta_ch_batt: 0.95 # Battery charge efficiency
eta_dch_batt: 0.98 # Battery discharge efficiency
DoD_batt: 0.2 # Depth of Discharge of the battery as a fraction of total capacity
SoC_init_batt: 0.2 # Initial state of charge of the battery as a fraction of total capacity
C_rate_batt: 1 # C-rate of 1 means the battery can be fully charged or discharged in 1 hour
